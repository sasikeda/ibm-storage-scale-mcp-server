# IBM Storage Scale MCP Server

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with IBM Storage Scale.

>[NOTE]
>This MCP server supports both StreamableHTTP and stdio transports. By default, it uses StreamableHTTP transport on `127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or later
- UV package manager (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
- Node.js 22 and npx (optional, for file operations support)
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo bash -
  sudo yum install -y nsolid
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IBM/ibm-storage-scale-mcp-server.git
   cd ibm-storage-scale-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using uv**:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install .
   ```

2. **Configure Scale connection settings**:
   
   ```bash
   cp config/scale_config.ini.example config/scale_config.ini
   ```
   
   Edit [`config/scale_config.ini`](config/scale_config.ini) with your IBM Storage Scale cluster details:
   
   ```ini
   [scale_api]
   hostname = your-scale-cluster.example.com
   v2_port = 443
   v3_port = 46443
   timeout = 5.0
   
   [authorization]
   username = your-username
   password = your-password
   allow_insecure = true
   
   [domain]
   domain = your-domain

   [ssh]
   # SSH connection settings for remote CLI commands
   hostname = your-scale-node.example.com
   port = 22
   username = your-username
   password = your-ssh-password
   key_path = your-ssh-key  # Alternative to password authentication
   ```

   Replace the placeholder values with your actual Scale cluster credentials and connection details.

   **Note:** The `[ssh]` section is required for CLI-based tools that execute commands directly on Scale nodes (such as policy operations). You can use either password or SSH key authentication (precedence over password authentication).

3. **Start the server using uv or python**:
   ```bash
   # Using uv (default: HTTP transport on localhost:8000)
   uv run scale-mcp-server
   ```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Run with HTTP transport on default port (localhost:8000)
scale-mcp-server --transport http

# Run with HTTP transport binding to all interfaces
scale-mcp-server --transport http --host 0.0.0.0

# Run with HTTP transport on custom port
scale-mcp-server --transport http --port 3000

# Run with stdio transport
scale-mcp-server --transport stdio

# Run with custom host, port, and log level
scale-mcp-server --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --log-level DEBUG
```

## Third-Party Integrations

The server supports optional third-party MCP server integrations to extend functionality beyond IBM Storage Scale management.

### File Operations

The server can optionally mount the [MCP filesystem server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) to provide local file operations alongside IBM Storage Scale management. This enables:

- Reading and writing files
- Creating and listing directories
- Moving files and directories
- Searching files with patterns
- Getting file metadata

**Usage:**
```bash
scale-mcp-server --transport http --filesystem-paths /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2
```

## Usage and Integration

### Using MCP Inspector

The MCP server can be tested directly using [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

#### Prerequisites

Follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start-ui-mode) from MCP Inspector.

#### Connecting via HTTP Transport

1. **Start the MCP server**:
   ```bash
   scale-mcp-server --transport http
   ```

2. **Connect MCP Inspector**:
   ```bash
   mcp-inspector http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Test the server**:
   - MCP Inspector will open in your browser
   - You can browse available tools
   - Test tool calls and verify responses

## Using with Agents

For a higher-level conversational interface, consider using the [IBM Storage Scale Agents](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-storage-scale-agents) which are built on top of this MCP server. The agents provide an intuitive way to manage IBM Storage Scale operations through natural language interactions.
